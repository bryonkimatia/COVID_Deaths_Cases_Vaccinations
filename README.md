# Covid Deaths SQL File

## Information.
Worldwide COVID-19 data - cases, deaths, and vaccinations with respect to location, continent, date, and population. From the analysis, I was able to determine the highest infection rate compared to population, total COVID cases and deaths (hence determining the death rate), join COVID deaths and vaccinations tables and determine vaccination trends in different countries.
